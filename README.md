# Overview

TL;DR: This is designed to be a lightweight capture of companies/organizations who have dedicated resources and positions for folks returning to their career after a long break.

Indeed has a good write-up on returnships [here](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/returnship).

Disclaimer: [I](https://github.com/pbarry25) am not directly affiliated with any of the companies listed here.

This is simplly a curated list of companies who seek out and invest in people who took time off from their field of work and are now returning to work.

Each row below contains links to the following:

* the company's main website
* the company's 'careers' landing page, if they have one (usually these are geared toward 'talking up' the benefits of joining the company)
* the current listing of open positions/jobs with the company
* any guidance that might be helpful to find/filter the "early friendly" listings

And PR's/feedback encouraged! :)
