# Overview

TL;DR: This is designed to be a lightweight capture of companies/organizations who have dedicated resources and positions for folks returning to their career after a long break.

Indeed has a good write-up on returnships [here](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/returnship).

Disclaimer: [I](https://github.com/pbarry25) am not directly affiliated with any of the companies listed here.

This is simplly a curated list of companies who seek out and invest in people who took time off from their field of work and are now returning to work.

Each row below contains links to the following:

* the company's main website
* the page/resource for their returnship program
* any related notes about the program

And PR's/feedback encouraged! :)
